### Hi, my name is Sergio! 👋

## About Me 📖
Hey all, my name is Sergio Talavera. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Software Engineering with a specialization in Data Science at San Jose State looking to graduate in 2025. I previously received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from UC San Diego in 2022. I am a first generation Peruvian-American, San Francisco Bay Area native and currently reside here. Previously, I have worked on Android Mobile App Development as well as Software Quality Assurance during my last internship. Personally and academically, I have worked on projects within machine learning, artificial intelligence, web development, data science, and computer architecture. I am currently searching for internship positions in Software Engineering, ML/AI Engineering, and Data Engineering. 

Outside of work, I have a few hobbies and activities that I really enjoy. For sports, I love snowboarding, surfing, and tennis. I also love cooking, film/television, hiking, and traveling.
