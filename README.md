# About Me
Hey all, my name is Sergio Talavera. I am a Peruvian first generation UC San Diego Computer Engineering '22 Grad. I am a San Francisco Bay Area native and currently reside here. Previously, I have worked on Android Mobile App Development as well as Software Quality Assurance during my last internship. Personally and academically, I have worked on projects within web development, machine learning, and computer architecture. I am currently searching for new grad and full time positions in Software Engineering. 

Outside of work, I have a few hobbies and activities that I really enjoy. For sports, I love snowboarding, surfing, and tennis - love having something for every season. I also love cooking, film/television, hiking, and traveling.
